# AutoFishing

A simple autofishing mod for Minecraft 1.21.1, feel free to use!

## Setup
- `/autofish true` will start the auto fishing mod. Do `/autofish false` to disable.
- `/delay (ticks)` is a command where you can set the delay of the rod being reeled in. The default value is 20 ticks, or 1 second on a 20 tps server. 1 tick is equal to 50ms.

## Key notes
- You need to hold a fishing rod in order to active auto fishing.
- Swapping from the fishing rod to a different item will automatically disable the auto fishing.
- Reeling in manually, your right mouse button, will automatically disable the auto fishing.
- The delay is reccomended to be set to 10-20 ticks.
